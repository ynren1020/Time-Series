Objective
To predict future EEG signal values based on historical time series data collected from wearable devices.
Data
We'll use hypothetical time series data that includes:
Timestamp: The time at which the data was recorded.
EEG Signal: Brain activity levels.

Steps
Data Preparation
Load the time series data.
Create lag features to capture the temporal dependencies.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training
Define a preprocessing recipe.
Specify a model using tidymodels.
Train the model using the training data.
Prediction and Evaluation
Make predictions on the testing data.
Evaluate the model’s performance.

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidymodels)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("wearable_data.csv")

# Convert timestamp to datetime and arrange by time
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(timestamp = ymd_hms(timestamp)) %>% 
  arrange(timestamp)

# Create lag features
create_lag_features <- function(data, lags) {
  for (lag in lags) {
    data <- data %>%
      mutate(!!paste0("eeg_signal_lag_", lag) := lag(eeg_signal, lag))
  }
  return(data)
}

# Define the lags
lags <- 1:5
data <- create_lag_features(data, lags)

# Drop missing values generated by lagging
data <- data %>% drop_na()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
data_split <- initial_time_split(data, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

# Define a recipe for preprocessing
eeg_recipe <- recipe(eeg_signal ~ ., data = train_data) %>%
  step_rm(timestamp) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())

# Define a model specification
xgb_spec <- boost_tree(
  trees = 1000,
  tree_depth = 6,
  min_n = 5,
  loss_reduction = 0.01,
  sample_size = 0.8,
  mtry = 3,
  learn_rate = 0.01
) %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

# Create a workflow
eeg_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(eeg_recipe) %>%
  add_model(xgb_spec)

# Train the model
eeg_fit <- eeg_workflow %>% 
  fit(data = train_data)

# Make predictions
eeg_predictions <- eeg_fit %>% 
  predict(new_data = test_data) %>%
  bind_cols(test_data)

# Evaluate the model
metrics <- eeg_predictions %>%
  metrics(truth = eeg_signal, estimate = .pred)

print(metrics)

# Plot the results
eeg_predictions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = timestamp)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = eeg_signal, color = "Actual")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .pred, color = "Predicted")) +
  labs(title = "EEG Signal Prediction using Tidymodels",
       x = "Time",
       y = "EEG Signal") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()

Explanation
Data Preparation:
The time series data is loaded and arranged by timestamp.
Lag features are created to capture temporal dependencies. For example, eeg_signal_lag_1 represents the EEG signal value at the previous timestamp.
Missing values generated by lagging are dropped.
The data is split into training and testing sets using initial_time_split.

Model Training:
A recipe is defined for preprocessing, which includes removing the timestamp and normalizing the predictors.
An XGBoost model specification is defined using boost_tree.
A workflow is created by combining the recipe and model specification.
The model is trained using the training data.
Prediction and Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the testing data.
The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
The actual and predicted EEG signal values are plotted for visual comparison.
Applications
Neurological Monitoring: Predicting future EEG signals can help in early detection of neurological disorders, enabling timely medical intervention.
Cognitive State Tracking: Wearable devices can provide insights into cognitive states (e.g., attention, relaxation) by predicting brain activity patterns.
Mental Health Management: Monitoring and predicting brain activity can assist in managing mental health conditions by identifying patterns associated with stress or relaxation.
This example demonstrates how the tidymodels framework can be effectively used for time series prediction with brain signal data from wearable devices.
