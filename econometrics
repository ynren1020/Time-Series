# chapter 14 Introduction to Time Series Regression and Forecasting
Time series data is collected for a single entity over time. This is fundamentally different from cross-section data which is data 
on multiple entities at the same point in time. Time series data allows estimation of the effect on Y of a change in X over time.
This is what econometricians call a dynamic causal effect. 
Let us go back to the application of cigarette consumption of Chapter 12 where we were interested in estimating the effect on cigarette
demand of a price increase caused by a raise of the general sales tax. One might use time series data to assess the causal effect a tax increase
on smoking both, initially and in subsequent periods.

Another application of time series data is forecasting. For example, weather services use time series data to predict tomorrow's temperature by,
inter alia, using today's temperature and temperatures of the past.
